# Known Issues - Phase 1

## Python 3.14 Compatibility

The project was originally designed for Python 3.12. Some dependencies have issues with Python 3.14:

1. **onnxruntime==1.21.1** - No Python 3.14 wheels available yet
2. **chromadb==0.3.23** - Uses old Pydantic BaseSettings location

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Use Python 3.12 (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Python 3.12 via Homebrew
brew install python@3.12

# Create venv with Python 3.12
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Install Minimal Dependencies
For testing the web chat API specifically, you only need:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic pydantic-settings openai httpx
pip install chromadb>=1.0.0  # Use newer version
pip install langgraph python-json-logger
```

### Option 3: Wait for Phase 1b
Phase 1b will remove WhatsApp-specific dependencies that are causing issues:
- onnxruntime (used for voice processing)
- Various Meta API dependencies
- Voice synthesis libraries

## Testing Without Full Setup

You can still test the code structure and imports:
```bash
# Syntax validation
python3 -m py_compile bt_servant_engine/adapters/web_messaging.py
python3 -m py_compile bt_servant_engine/apps/api/routes/chat.py

# Run unit tests for just the web chat components
pytest tests/test_web_chat.py -v
```

## What Works Now

✅ Code is committed and pushed to GitHub
✅ Architecture is correct (ports & adapters pattern)
✅ Unit tests are written
✅ Example usage code is ready
✅ Both WhatsApp and Web chat can coexist

## What Needs Full Setup

❌ Running the actual server requires resolving dependency issues
❌ Integration testing requires OpenAI API key and ChromaDB
❌ RAG functionality needs bible data sources loaded

## Recommendation

Proceed to Phase 1b now - removing WhatsApp code will also remove the problematic dependencies.
